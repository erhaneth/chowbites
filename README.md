## Key React Concepts

ChowBites is a great example of a React application that brings together key concepts covered in our React course. Here are some of the core React features you'll see in action:

- **Components:** The app is built using reusable React components that make up the user interface.
- **State Management:** The app uses React state to keep track of the meals added to the cart, their quantities, and other dynamic data.
- **Event Handling:** User interactions, such as adding meals to the cart and adjusting quantities, are handled using event listeners and event handlers.
